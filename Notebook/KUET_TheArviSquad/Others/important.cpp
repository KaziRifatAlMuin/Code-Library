BS[1] = BS[7] = 1;
cout<<BS._Find_first()<<endl; // prints 1
bs._Find_next(idx). This function 
returns first set bit after index idx.for example:
bitset<17>BS;
BS[1] = BS[7] = 1;
cout<<BS._Find_next(1)<<','<<
BS._Find_next(3)<<endl; // prints 7,7
So this code will print all 
of the set bits of BS:
for(int i=BS._Find_first();
  i< BS.size();i = BS._Find_next(i))
    cout<<i<<endl;
//Note that there isn't any set 
    bit after idx, BS._Find_next(idx) 
    will return BS.size(); same as 
    calling BS._Find_first() when 
    bitset is clear;

Every tree = one nim pile = tree root value; 
tree leaf value = 0; tree node value = mex of 
all child nodes.
[Careful: one tree node can become multiple 
new tree roots(multiple elements in one node), 
then the value of that node = xor of all those root values] 
>Hackenbush on graph (instead of tree given 
an rooted graph): 
fusion: All edges in a cycle can be fused to 
get a tree structure; build a super node, 
connect some single nodes with that super node,
number of single nodes is the number of edges in the cycle.
Sol: [Bridge component tree] mark all bridges, 
a group of edges that are not bridges, becomes 
one component and contributes number of edges 
to the hackenbush. (even number of edges contributes 0, 
odd number of edges contributes 1)
